                Hi im Danisha Del Monaco! I currently reside in Edgewater, NJ. I recieved my associates at BCC in
                General Professional Studies. I continued my education at NJCU attempting to recieve my BS in Biology,
                however plans changed. Sometimes the plan that we have in store for ourselves is much different than
                what is meaant for us. Therefore, here I am starting something out of my elemebt and in all honesty I
                absolutely love it!
                I love photography! Generally I prefer taking pictures of landscapes rather than portraits of
                individual, of course everyone has their prefernece and for me I feel that I can enjoy the beauty of
                different things through photograpy. I like to write therefore, for many of pictures I write a story
                behind it. Photography is amazing because sometimes you would want to wish you could simply go back in
                time not to chnage anything but to relive a very moment that wa so special, if you just pick up that
                photo its almost like you are there all over again.
                I love cooking! My father was a chef and owned his own frestuarant so im sure thats where my passion for
                cooking must have came from.
